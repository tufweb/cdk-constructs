# Swagger ui

An implementation of the swagger-ui to allow simple deployment of API documentation when using the SpecRestFromAPI construct

## It deploys a plain HTTP implementation of the Swagger UI

This implementation is not ideal as it has external dependencies, but it's good for now.

A future release will use the express framework to serve the site without external dependencies.
